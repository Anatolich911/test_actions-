# test_actions-
The command in question is part of a GitHub Actions job step and performs several actions:

mvn help:evaluate: This invokes Maven's help goal with the evaluate phase, which is used to get the value of an expression. In this case, the expression is project.version.

-Dexpression=project.version: This option tells Maven that the expression to evaluate is project.version. This is a property in the Maven project's pom.xml file that specifies the version of the project.

-q: This stands for "quiet" and reduces the Maven output to only what's necessary. It's intended to prevent extraneous logging from cluttering the output.

-DforceStdout: Normally, the output of the evaluated expression would be sent to a log file. This option forces Maven to output the result directly to the standard output (stdout), which is the command line.

echo "VERSION=$(...) >> $GITHUB_ENV: This takes the output from the Maven command, which should be the project version, and assigns it to an environment variable called VERSION using echo. The $(...) syntax is command substitution in Bash, which takes the output of the command inside the parentheses and uses it as the argument to echo.

>> $GITHUB_ENV: This appends the output (in this case, the VERSION environment variable declaration) to the GitHub Actions environment variable file $GITHUB_ENV. By appending to this file, the VERSION variable will be set for all subsequent steps in the workflow.

In summary, this command extracts the version of the project as defined in the pom.xml file and sets it as an environment variable VERSION that can be used in subsequent steps of the GitHub Actions workflow.
